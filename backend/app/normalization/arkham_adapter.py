"""Arkham UI CSV export -> canonical EVM transfer mapping (Path A).

See `docs/findings/arkham_export_reconciliation.md`. The Arkham logged-in "download" export is a
**transfer log** (one row = one A→B value movement, 19 columns) — NOT the attribution schema the first
`arkham.py` was built against. This pure adapter (no HTTP/DB) maps **EVM** rows onto the canonical
`transfer` fact path, reusing etherscan_adapter's `ParsedTransaction`/`ParsedTransfer` shape so the DB
writer resolves addresses/assets to ids.

**Chain branch (Invariant #5 — critical).** Arkham emits the SAME `fromAddress → toAddress` shape for
Bitcoin (`chain=bitcoin`, `type=inflow`), and `fromAddress` is sometimes a comma-joined *set* of input
addresses — i.e. it collapses the UTXO input set into one from→to pair. Writing that as a `transfer`
fact would synthesize an input→output edge, which Invariant #5 forbids (BTC stores `tx_input`/`tx_output`
only, and this export doesn't carry the real UTXO structure). So this adapter only builds transfers for
**account-model (EVM) chains** (`NATIVE_SYMBOL`, incl. **bsc**). Non-EVM rows split into two classes the
connector treats differently: **UTXO** (Bitcoin → `notes["rejected_utxo"]`, a hard Invariant #5 refusal)
and **unsupported account-model** (e.g. **Tron** → `notes["rejected_unsupported"]` — account-model but
not modelled here; NOT a fabrication risk, so it's skipped, not an invariant breach). Arkham chain ids are
alias-normalized to the system's canonical names first (`ARKHAM_CHAIN_ALIASES`).

Resolved decisions (full reconciliation in the findings note; `TODO: confirm` where the export can't settle it):

(a) **`unitValue` is a DISPLAY value, not base units** (confirmed: BTC `unitValue=0.00000546`, decimals=8 →
    546 sats; EVM USDT `historicalUSD==unitValue==32` for a $1 token). `Transfer.amount` is a raw
    base-unit integer, so `amount = round(Decimal(unitValue) × 10^decimals)` — parsed via `Decimal`, never
    float. A product with MORE precision than `decimals` is flagged `rounded` and surfaced. **Honesty
    caveat:** the commoner loss — Arkham *truncating* a high-decimal token's display (e.g. showing
    `1.2346` for a true `1.234567…`) — yields an *integral* product, so the `rounded` flag misses it;
    **FN-24/P19 now catches it separately** — a non-zero amount whose display carried FEWER fractional
    digits than `decimals` is counted in `notes["truncation_risk"]` (surfaced by the connector) so the
    low-order-lossy figure is never taken as silently authoritative. It is still recorded (the movement
    happened) but flagged; the authoritative low-order value needs a chain re-fetch (Etherscan/Bitquery).
    *TODO: confirm exactness for high-decimal tokens.*

(b) **`type` is DIRECTION, not the transfer-type enum.** Arkham's `type` is `inflow`/`outflow` relative to
    the queried subject (empty when neither party is the subject) — NOT `native/erc20/internal`. We derive
    `transfer_type` from `tokenAddress` presence (token ⇒ `erc20`, else `native`). `internal` is not
    distinguishable from this export. *TODO: confirm `internal`/contract-interaction representation.*

(c) **`position`:** no log index in the export → `position` = the row's 0-based index within its
    `(tx_hash, transfer_type)` group, in CSV row order — so RE-INGESTING THE SAME FILE is idempotent
    (Invariant #7). Cross-source caveat (surfaced as a follow-up): these positions need not align with
    Etherscan's log-order positions, so the same tx from both sources could yield two transfer rows.

(d) **finality:** no `confirmations` column → every tx is `provisional` (honest: not confirmed), upgraded
    to `final` by a later idempotent chain re-fetch (Invariant #6). Never frozen final on a guess.

(e) **dropped columns** (no canonical slot; we do NOT extend the schema for import-only metadata):
    `blockHash`, `tokenName`, `from/toIsContract`, `from/toLabel`. `tokenId` is a **coin slug** (e.g.
    `tether`/`bitcoin`, DeFiLlama-style pricing key) — NOT an erc721 id — and is not needed for the raw
    transfer; it would only matter for a future valuation join.

(f) **`historicalUSD`** is a SOURCED valuation claim, not a raw fact — kept OUT of the transfer write, but
    carried on the ``ParsedTransfer`` (``historical_usd``) so the connector records it as a SECOND
    ``valuation`` claim (``source='arkham'``) alongside DeFiLlama — never merged (Invariant #4). It is the
    source's stated *total* USD value-at-time; a malformed/absent value writes NO valuation (honest gap).

NOT done — attribution: address→entity/label/confidence is not in any UI export; it requires Arkham's
official API (Path B, Invariant #1). `from/toLabel` are too thin (often bare addresses) to synthesize from.
